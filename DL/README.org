* Introduction
Two Goal to take:
1. Articles structures for writing
2. Gain informations

So, (temporary) process of that I read paper as follows:
1. Analysis structures
2. Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion or Discussion
3. Technological details, Concept, and Comparison again and again

Notes structure contains those parts:
1. what problem is not solved yet or why we should research it
2. what solution authors proposed, or contribution
3. how authors to solve this problem

In the end, you can find more details about how to read paper as follows:
